# find the median of two sorted arraysself.
# eg
# arr1 = [1,3,5]
# arr2 = [2,4,6]

# median(arr1, arr2) = 3.5
#Questions for interviewer:
#1. Are the arrays the same lenght?
#2. How do you want to deal with the two median elements (this example is averaging them, but he may said just return the two median elements)
